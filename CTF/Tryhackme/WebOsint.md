## Difficulty = Easy
***

HolaðŸ‘‹ Welcome back. Here is a walkthrough on [WebOsint](https://tryhackme.com/room/webosint) based on TryHackMe. It covers learning how to conduct basic open source intelligence research on a website.

![web](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/9af6f2d8-f7a2-47db-aa4b-3a201b3870bf)

## What is WebOsint all about ðŸ¤” ?
**_WebOSINT stands for "Web Open Source Intelligence." It refers to the practice of gathering intelligence or information from publicly available online sources. This can include social media platforms, websites, forums, blogs, public databases, and any other online resources where information is openly accessible._**

## Task 1: When A Website Does Not Exist 
The first thing we do when we are given the name of a website/business to check out is fire up the ol' web browser, find the website, and check it out, right?
#### What if the website, or even the entire business, no longer exists?
That does NOT mean it's the end of the road. So let's begin.
This OSINT challenge starts off by focusing on a domain called ``RepublicofKoffee.com``.
It should be noted that when this challenge was created, the website related to that domain did not exist. Our job is to find as much information as you can about the website RepublicofKoffee.com. Let's get started and look for information that we can find from the website.

### Q1: Click To Complete
Answer: No Answer Needed

***
## Task 2: Whois Registration
Just because nothing shows up when you visit 'RepublicOfKoffee.com,' doesn't mean that someone doesn't own the domain. We can confirm the current registration status with a WHOIS lookup.
A 'WHOIS' lookup is the most basic form of domain reconnaissance available. There are multiple websites that will do it for you as well.

### Q1: What is the name of the company the domain was registered with?
- First, let's look up the domain name using the [WHOIS website](https://www.whois.com/). The WHOIS tool is used to retrieve information about domain names, including registration details, the domain owner's contact information, registration and expiration dates, name server information, and more.

- Answer: Namecheap Inc

### Q2: What phone number is listed for the registration company? (do not include country code or special characters/spaces)
- We can gather a lot of information about the website by using OSINT tools

![osint 5](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/8977f544-1e5c-4515-a193-8d334b887ac9)

### Q3: What is the first nameserver listed for the site?

![osint 6](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/b43e7d7f-1c05-4f52-a7fb-cd1d62926783)

### Q4: What is listed for the name of the registrant?

![osint 7](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/c5a658db-8c45-43f7-8d85-acc579e33342)

### Q5: What country is listed for the registrant?
- We got the name of the country, which is 'IS,' but that is a short code for a country. By using this [website](https://www.iban.com/country-codes), we can determine that the country is Iceland or by conducting research on the city Reykjavik, which is the capital of Iceland.

- Answer: Iceland

## Task 3: Ghosts of Websites Past 
Don't be discouraged if your initial searches on a website yield no results. That's where [Archive.org](https://archive.org/web/) and the Internet Wayback Machine come into play.

#### What is Internet Wayback Machine ðŸš™ ?
**_The Wayback Machine, is an online digital archive maintained by the Internet Archive. It stores snapshots of web pages taken at various points in time, allowing users to access historical versions of websites. This archive enables users to view how websites looked and what content they contained at different points in the past. It serves as a valuable resource for research, historical preservation, and accessing information that may have been removed or changed on the live web._**

- Looking at the historical information available for the site, you should be able to answer the following questions:

### Q1: What is the first name of the blog's author?
- I entered the domain name into the Wayback Machine and found the website. It was a blogging site. I opened one of the blogs and discovered the name of the author.

### Q2: What city and country was the author writing from?
- By reading each and every blog, one consistent detail was the mention of the city name "Gwangju." Upon conducting research, it was found to be located in South Korea.

![osint 15](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/35467ea3-65c8-4a4b-b0ad-e762ad8d0baa)

- Answer: Gwangju, South Korea

### Q3: [Research] What is the name (in English) of the temple inside the National Park the author frequently visits?
- I got one blog where the author mentioned finding himself having a meeting in `Mudeungsan National Park` in Gwangju. By conducting research, I found the English name.

- Answer: Jeungsimsa Temple

## Task 4: Digging into DNS 
So far we've gathered some good info about the content that was on our target website, even though it hasn't been live for several years.
But what about technical details? That's where [ViewDNS.info](https://viewdns.info) comes in. 
**_ViewDNS.info is a website offering tools and services related to DNS and domain information. It allows users to look up domain details, perform reverse IP lookups, check DNS propagation status, generate DNS reports, and conduct domain research. It's a valuable resource for gathering domain-related information and troubleshooting DNS issues._**
- Take a look at the search options available and we can answer the question below:

### Q1: What was RepublicOfKoffee.com's IP address as of October 2016?
- Use the IP History tool, which shows the historical IP addresses associated with a domain.

![osint 18](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/9aa39f9c-7f15-4a72-b08b-8595e0e58f78)

### Q2: Based on the other domains hosted on the same IP address, what kind of hosting service can we safely assume our target uses?

![osint 19](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/26ff94ba-f4c6-421a-a37a-48b0850bc84c)

- But we get that. By checking the hint question: What kind of hosting plan is usually used by websites on a tight budget that don't have a lot of visitors? The answer is  `shared` because Shared hosting is a type of web hosting service where multiple websites are hosted on a single physical server.

- Answer: Shared
