## Task 1: When A Website Does Not Exist 
The first thing we do when we are given the name of a website/business to check out is fire up the ol' web browser, find the website, and check it out, right?
### What if the website, or even the entire business, no longer exists?
That does NOT mean it's the end of the road. So let's begin.
This OSINT challenge starts off by focusing on a domain called ``RepublicofKoffee.com``.
It should be noted that when this challenge was created, the website related to that domain did not exist. Our job is to find as much information as you can about the website RepublicofKoffee.com. Let's get started and look for information that we can find from the website.
