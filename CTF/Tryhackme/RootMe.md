Hola ðŸ‘‹, Here is my write-up on [RootMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme) , based on the TryHackMe CTF. It covers learning reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and reverse shell techniques.

## Task 1: Deploy the machine
- So, I started by connecting to the TryHackMe network and deploying the machine.

## Task 2: Reconnaissance
### Q1: how many ports are open?
- So, I began by utilizing one of the best enumeration and scanning tools, which is `Nmap`. Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.

- Running our nmap scan, give us this:

```powershell
# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Sat Mar  2 16:09:04 2024 as: nmap -sC -sV -oN ./myfile.txt 10.10.88.68
Nmap scan report for 10.10.88.68
Host is up (0.20s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)

```




And we can see that we have 2 ports open from our Nmap scan.
- Answer: 2

### Q2: What version of Apache is running?
- From our `nmap` scan port 80 https is running of Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))

- Answer: 2.4.29

### Q3: What service is running on port 22?
- Answer: SSH

### Q4: Find directories on the web server using the GoBuster tool.
- Answer: No Answer Needed

### Q5: What is the hidden directory?
- Using Gobuster, a command-line tool utilized for directory and file brute-forcing on web servers, we were able to uncover the hidden directory.
