# RootMe
### Difficulty = Easy
***
Hola ðŸ‘‹, Here is my write-up on [RootMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/rrootme) , based on the TryHackMe CTF. It covers learning reconnaissance, privilege escalation, and reverse shell techniques.

## Task 1: Deploy the machine
- So, I started by connecting to the TryHackMe network and deploying the machine.

## Task 2: Reconnaissance
### Q1: how many ports are open?
- So, I began by utilizing one of the best enumeration and scanning tools, which is `Nmap`. Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.

- Running our nmap scan, give us this:

```powershell
# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Sat Mar  2 16:09:04 2024 as: nmap -sC -sV -oN ./myfile.txt 10.10.88.68
Nmap scan report for 10.10.88.68
Host is up (0.20s latency).
Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.3 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
| ssh-hostkey: 
|   2048 4a:b9:16:08:84:c2:54:48:ba:5c:fd:3f:22:5f:22:14 (RSA)

```




And we can see that we have 2 ports open from our Nmap scan.
- Answer: 2

### Q2: What version of Apache is running?
- From our `nmap` scan port 80 https is running of Apache httpd 2.4.29 ((Ubuntu))

- Answer: 2.4.29

### Q3: What service is running on port 22?
- Answer: SSH

### Q4: Find directories on the web server using the GoBuster tool.
- Answer: No Answer Needed

### Q5: What is the hidden directory?
- Using Gobuster, a command-line tool utilized for directory and file brute-forcing on web servers, we were able to uncover the hidden directory.

- Answer: /Panel/

## Task 3: Getting a shell
### Q1: Find a form to upload and get a reverse shell, and find the flag.
- We have to Find a form for uploading files to obtain a reverse shell, and then locate the flag. In this scenario, access the IP address via a web browser. The hidden directory named "panel" will lead you to the upload form.

- We can go here to find [PHP reverse shell scripts](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php). What we need to do is create a "shell.php" file that we can upload onto the vulnerable server used to establish a backdoor connection to a compromised server.
- So, we can create a file with nano, for example, "example.php". This will open the nano editor where you can copy-paste the payload from the Git repository. Afterwards, we need to change the "ip_addr" and port to the desired values for our communication. In this case, I use port 4444, but you can use any port convenient for you. Then, use the IP address of your TryHackMe (THM) VPN if you are connected using the VPN. Or using the attackbox.
scroll down you will see something similar.

- After completing the process, it's time to upload it to the /panel/ directory that we discovered earlier. However, what's this? It appears the server isn't accepting .php files. What should we do in this situation? We're aware that we have a .php file, and PHP files can be disguised with various extensions. A brief search on Google reveals alternative extensions such as: .php3, .php4, .php5, .php7, .phtml, .pht. Then, the .php5 extension finally works! Bingo! ðŸ˜‚
