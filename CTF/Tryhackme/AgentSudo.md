# Agent Sudo
### Diffcuity: Easy

***
"Welcome back ðŸ‘‹! Here is my write-up on Agent Sudo, based on the TryHackMe CTF. In this challenge, we discovered a secret server hidden deep beneath the sea. Our task was to breach its defenses and uncover the truth within. Throughout the room, we learn into topics such as hash cracking, privilege escalation, and steganography, among others. Let's dive in ðŸ•º.

## Task 1: Author note
### Deploy the machine

*** 
## Task 2: Enumerate
Enumerate the machine to gather all important information. Enumeration is the process of gathering information about a target system or network.

### Q1: How many open ports?
-  So, I began by utilizing one of the best enumeration and scanning tools, which is `Nmap`. Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
- Running our nmap scan, give us this:

```powershell
# Nmap 7.94SVN scan initiated Tue Apr 16 23:17:19 2024 as: nmap -sV -A -oN ./nmap_result.txt 10.10.58.229
Nmap scan report for 10.10.58.229
Host is up (0.20s latency).
Not shown: 997 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
