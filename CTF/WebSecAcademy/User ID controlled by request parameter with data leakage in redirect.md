# Access Control
## Lab:~# User ID controlled by request parameter with data leakage in redirect 

Guys ðŸ‘‹ welcome back! Here is another write-up on a web security academy lab. This lab contains an access control vulnerability where sensitive information is leaked in the body of a redirect response. Let's get started and exploit it.

### End Goals :~#
- Solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user carlos and submit it as the solution.
- You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter

*** 
### Testing For Vulnerabilities: 
- In some cases, an application detects when the user is not permitted to access the resource and returns a redirect to the login page.

- Log in using the supplied credentials to access your account page, and then let's send the request to reapter.
- Modify the value of the 'id' parameter to 'carlos' and send it. Carefully observe the response: it now redirects you to the homepage, but the body contains the API key belonging to Carlos.

- Copy the API key and submit. We solve the lab easily, right ðŸ˜‚
