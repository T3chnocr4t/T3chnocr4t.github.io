# Files Upload Vulnerabilities
### Lab:# Remote code execution via web shell upload

Guys ðŸ‘‹, let's go through this really quick. This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn't perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server's filesystem.

Our task is to solve the lab by uploading a basic PHP web shell and using it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner. Let's get started.

### End Goals:
- Upload the basic php web shell
- And get the content of the file /home/carlos/secret.

### What is File Upload Vulnerabilities ðŸ¤”
**_File upload vulnerabilities is when a web sever allow the user to upload files to it filesytem without sufficiently valiating things like their name, type, content and size._**

### Enummeration/ Testing for Vulnerabilities

- First, to test a web app for vulnerabilities, we have to check each functionality of the web app. So, let's log in to our account and check how the web app works.

- So, it has a functionality for uploading an avatar image. Let's try uploading our basic PHP web shell and check if the web application validates it.

- On your machine, create a file called anyname.phpâ€”in my case, I used rick.phpâ€”containing a script for fetching the contents of Carlos's secret file. Add this script to the file:
```
<?php echo file_get_contents('/home/carlos/secret'); ?>
```
- Let's try uploading the malicious PHP file to the upload image function. If the web app doesn't validate it, and the script is successful, bingo! ðŸ˜‚

- Let's send the request to the Repeater tab and modify it. In Burp Repeater, change the path of the request to point to your PHP file:
- And get Carlos's key. Submit it to complete the lab.
