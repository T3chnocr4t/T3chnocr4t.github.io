# Authentication
### Lab#: 2FA simple bypass
***

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ back , friends! Here is my write-up on [2FA simple bypass](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/server-side-vulnerabilities-apprentice/authentication-apprentice/authentication/multi-factor/lab-2fa-simple-bypass) based on Web Security Academy labs. The web app has a two-factor authentication functionality that can be bypassed. We have already obtained a valid username and password but do not have access to the user's 2FA verification code. Our task is to bypass the verification code for the 2FA. Let's get started, guys.
