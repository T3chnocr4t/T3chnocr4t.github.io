## Lab #4: User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs

Hola ðŸ‘‹ welcome back. This is the Lab 4# [User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/server-side-vulnerabilities-apprentice/access-control-apprentice/access-control/lab-user-id-controlled-by-request-parameter-with-unpredictable-user-ids#) write-up of the Access Control labs on WebSec Academy. 
This task revolves around a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability. The web app identifies each user with GUIDs for their user account pages. We need to locate the GUID for user Carlos and submit his API key as the solution. Let's get started.
