Hola ðŸ‘‹ welcome back. This is the Lab 2# [Unprotected Admin Functionality with Unpredictable URL](https://portswigger.net/web-security/learning-paths/server-side-vulnerabilities-apprentice/access-control-apprentice/access-control/lab-unprotected-admin-functionality-with-unpredictable-url) write-up of the Access Control labs on WebSec Academy. We are given the task to access the admin panel and delete the user Carlos. Let's get started!

- Using Burp Suite, send the main page request to the Repeater tab.

- From the labâ€™s main page, letâ€™s first test for unprotected functionality within the URL and check the "robots.txt" file (a text file placed on a website that instructs web robots which pages or files they can or cannot access). However, we encountered an error: "not found".

- Next, let's check the source code of the main lab's page for any comments or JavaScript that were accidentally left behind during development or production that disclose the admin panel functionality.
- We found the path to the admin panel.

- Navigating to the path gives us a 200 OK response. We accessed the admin pages and, checking the source code, found the URL to delete the user Carlos.
