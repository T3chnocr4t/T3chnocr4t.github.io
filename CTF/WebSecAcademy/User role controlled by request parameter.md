- Using Burp Suite, send the main page request to the Repeater tab to test for unprotected functionality to access the administrative functions. Browsing to the relevant admin URL, in this case, specifying `/admin` as the path, results in a 401 error, indicating "unauthorized."

- Let's log in to our own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter. We'll use the proxy tab and turn on the intercept to modify a request. Let's see ðŸ‘€.

- We can see that we are using the POST method (sending data to the server). We can send the request to the Repeater tab and modify it more effectively there.
- Modify the request by changing the path to "/admin" and setting the cookie header value of "admin" to true. And use the cookie to acces the admin panel. Sending this request should take us to the admin panel. Bingo ðŸ˜‚

- Checking the response source, we can identify the path to delete the user "Carlos." Upon following the redirection, we can proceed to delete the user "Carlos" and successfully complete the labs.

And we complete our goal by accessing the admin panel and deleting the user "Carlos".
