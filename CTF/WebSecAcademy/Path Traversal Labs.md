# Path Traversal

Hola ðŸ‘‹ welcome back, guys! Here is my write-up on all the labs in Path Traversal on Web Sec Academy, curated in one place. I will go through how I solved each lab. Let's get started!

### What is Path Traversal ðŸ¤”
**_Path traversal is also known as directory traversal. These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include: Application code and data, Credentials for back-end systems, Sensitive operating system files._**

### Lab #1: 
End Goal:
- This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images. To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

- In Burp, check for any image product request and send it to the Repeater tab.

- This application implements no defenses against path traversal attacks. By modifying the request, we can retrieve the /etc/passwd file from the server's filesystem by stepping up one level in the directory structure. The three consecutive ../ sequences step up from /var/www/images/ to the filesystem root, and so the file that is actually read is /etc/passwd. We receive a 200 OK status code, indicating that the request was successful. We've successfully solved the first lab. Nice! Let's move on to the next one.

### Lab #2: File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass
End Goal:
- This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images. The application blocks traversal sequences but treats the supplied filename as being relative to a default working directory.
- To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

![1a](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/7e00f45a-76c7-48e3-8d3f-d76552610ad8)

- So, send any request for an image product to the Repeater tab. By modifying the request, we can use an absolute path (an absolute path is a file or directory location specified from the root directory, represented by /) to access the /etc/passwd file on the server. Specify /etc/passwd as the value of the filename parameter, and we solve the lab. Let's move on.

### Lab #3: File path traversal, traversal sequences stripped non-recursively
End Goal:
- To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

![2a](https://github.com/T3chnocr4t/T3chnocr4t.github.io/assets/115868619/82dfd868-9b9f-46f8-aac7-50c85241312b)

- Send any image product request to the Repeater tab. We are going to use nested traversal sequences, such as ....// or ....\/, which are techniques used in path traversal attacks to bypass input validation filters. To access the /etc/passwd file on the server, put this path in the value of the filename parameter. This will solve the lab.
