# Path Traversal

Hola ðŸ‘‹ welcome back, guys! Here is my write-up on all the labs in Path Traversal on Web Sec Academy, curated in one place. I will go through how I solved each lab. Let's get started!

### What is Path Traversal ðŸ¤”
**_Path traversal is also known as directory traversal. These vulnerabilities enable an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server that is running an application. This might include: Application code and data, Credentials for back-end systems, Sensitive operating system files._**

### Lab #1: 
- End Goal: This lab contains a path traversal vulnerability in the display of product images. To solve the lab, retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

- In Burp, check for any image product request and send it to the Repeater tab.

- This application implements no defenses against path traversal attacks. By modifying the request, we can retrieve the /etc/passwd file from the server's filesystem by stepping up one level in the directory structure. The three consecutive ../ sequences step up from /var/www/images/ to the filesystem root, and so the file that is actually read is /etc/passwd. We receive a 200 OK status code, indicating that the request was successful. We've successfully solved the first lab. Nice! Let's move on to the next one.
