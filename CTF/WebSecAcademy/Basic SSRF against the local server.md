# SSRF
### Lab#: Basic SSRF against the local server

Guys ðŸ‘‹, letâ€™s go through this really quick. This is an SSRF lab on PortSwigger Academy. This lab has a stock check feature that fetches data from an internal system. The task is to solve the lab by changing the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user Carlos. Letâ€™s get started.

### End Goal:
- Access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.

### What is SSRFðŸ¤”
**_Server-side request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause the server-side application to make requests to an unintended location._**

***
### Testing for vulnerabilties
- Let's check the functionality of the web app.

- There are many products listed in the web app. Letâ€™s visit a product and click "Check Stock." In Burp, letâ€™s check each request we make. Check the Proxy tab, and we can see our request. Letâ€™s send it to the Repeater tab.

- Letâ€™s modify the value of the stockApi parameter to `http://localhost/admin or http://127.0.0.1/admin`. This will display the admin interface.

- Modifying the request gets us to the admin interface. Reading the HTML, we can see the URL to delete the target user, which is: `http://127.0.0.1/admin/delete?username=carlos`. Letâ€™s submit this URL as the value in the stockApi parameter, and we solve the lab.
