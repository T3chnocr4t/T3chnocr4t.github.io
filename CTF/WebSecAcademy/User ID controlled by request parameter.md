Guys ðŸ‘‹, welcome back. Let's go through this lab real quick. This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on a user account page. Let's try to exploit the vulnerabilities.

To solve the lab, we need to obtain the API key for the user Carlos and submit it as the solution. Note: Am using caido you can follow along using burp also..

### What Horizontal privilege escalation ðŸ¤”?
Horizontal privilege escalation occurs if a user is able to gain access to resources belonging to another user, instead of their own resources of that type.

- Let's log in to our account using the following credentials and test all features in the application. Turn on our proxy to collect requests. See how the web app handles requests, processes our requests, and identifies users.
- When log in, let's check our proxy. We can see that the web app identifies the user in the URL. The value of the id parameter contain our username.. NiceðŸ˜‚
